### False Positives Skipped (4)

- `app-shell.tsx` routes search to `/map` — **out of scope** (not in diff); also Next.js redirects preserve query params by default
- `header-nav.tsx` hardcoded `/map` link — **out of scope** (not in diff); redirect handles it
- Trailing-space alignment in TABS — **formatter territory** (prettier handles this in CI)
- selectedShop render structure difference from plan — **functionally equivalent** (ternary vs two conditionals)

### Validation Results

- Skipped (false positive): `app-shell.tsx:*` — out of scope; redirect preserves query params
- Skipped (false positive): `header-nav.tsx:*` — out of scope
- Skipped (false positive): TABS whitespace alignment — CI formatter territory
- Skipped (false positive): selectedShop ternary vs two conditionals — functionally identical
- Proceeding to fix: 8 valid issues (1 Critical, 3 Important, 4 Minor)

## Fix Pass 1

**Pre-fix SHA:** 9d83d58e828332d627bc507e738a6329b5973318

**Issues fixed:**

- [Critical] app/page.tsx:23 — Extracted `FindPageContent`, wrapped in `<Suspense>` in exported `FindPage`; `useSearchParams()` now inside Suspense boundary
- [Important] app/page.tsx — Added `activeFilters.includes('rating')` sort to shops `useMemo`, restoring parity with old `applySort` behavior
- [Important] app/page.tsx:99 — Removed `onOpenSheet={() => {}}` no-op; made `onOpenSheet` optional in `FilterPills`, button conditionally rendered only when handler provided
- [Important] components/navigation/bottom-nav.tsx — Added lucide-react icons (Map, Compass, Heart, User) to each tab per design spec
- [Minor] app/page.test.tsx — Replaced placeholder test data (id: '1', empty timestamps) with realistic UUID, Taiwanese café name, ISO timestamps
- [Minor] app/page.test.tsx — Removed redundant `@/components/map/map-view` mock (next/dynamic mock is sufficient)
- [Minor] components/navigation/bottom-nav.test.tsx — Renamed 3 test cases to user-journey framing
- [Minor] app/explore/page.test.tsx — Renamed test case to user-journey framing
- [Minor] components/map/map-list-view.tsx + test — Deleted orphaned dead code (not imported anywhere in production)

**Batch Test Run:**

- `pnpm test` — 5 failures, all pre-existing (4 map-view, 1 search-bar; confirmed in handoff notes as present on main before branch)
